In this folder you will find the material used in the Isadora Patches

## makey_makey.izz

A demo Isadora file for the use of a MakeyMakey (https://makeymakey.com/) board. For Isadora an MakeyMakey is basically a keyboard and/or mouse so KeyboardWatchers play a central role in this file. With the Makey-Makey however it is important to use a bit of logic sometimes. For example if with a switch a key is kept pressed how do you handel the stream of incoming pulses? This file is here to help you with that.
